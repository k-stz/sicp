This function implements Horner's Rule: It can be proven that any algorithm that computes
arbitrary polynomials must at least use as man additions and multiplications as Horner's
rule, thus Horner's Rule is an optimal algorithm for polynomial evaluation!

This was proved (for the number additions) by A.M. Otrowski in 1954 paper that essentially
founded the modern study of optional algorithms. While V.Y.Pan 1966 proved it for
muliplications."
